# Pizzeria-Software
A software developed by myself for a Pizzeria ordering system. For the back end I have used Python with the feature of Flask server and for the front - end I have used Java Script, HTML and CSS. The software has all features that a pizzeria needs such as a wide range menu, different pizza sizes and staff pages.
