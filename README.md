# Pizzeria-Software
A software developed by myself for a Pizzeria ordering system. For the back end I have used Python with the feature of Flask server and for the front - end I have used Java Script, HTML and CSS. The software has all features that a pizzeria needs such as a wide range menu, different pizza sizes and staff pages. 
The code is also compatible with an Arduino board, with a connected Smart Rich Shield. It is used by one of the staff members in order to help him manage the complete order easier by displaying order numbers, playing a sound whenever a pizza is ready to be taken out of the oven and changing the turned on LED lights when certain conditions are met. For each order there is a timer, which originally should be set to 3 minuter (180 seconds), but for the test of the code, right now it is set to only 30, so the user can more easily and faster see how it works. (*It can always be changed in the python code by everybody to the amount you want*). In the python code, the Arduino board parts are commented out, so you can run it without such boardd, however, if you own such you can connect it and comment - out these lines.
